## Project Description
<hr>

* The Navigation bar was built by using ` append `and ` for ` loop.

* The smooth scroll to section on link click was made with using the click event and ` scrollIntoView  ` function with the behaviour set to smooth.

* Adding active class to both the links and the sections was achived with using Intersection Observer API method to set the place of the section and looping over it with forEach loop, also, making the code running into a conditional ` if ` to set the the sections and links to add or remove active class.
